# DVS Design Documentation - Agent Guide

> Historical note (January 21, 2026): This design set is preserved for context only. The authoritative, sync-first design docs live in `dvsexperimental_design/`. Expect mismatches with current code and CLI behavior.

This document explains the structure and purpose of the design documentation in this directory, intended to help AI agents and developers quickly navigate and understand the DVS codebase.

---

## Purpose

These indices were created to enable efficient lookup of:

- Which files are most important for specific tasks
- How components relate to each other
- What functionality exists and where it's implemented
- Error types and their causes
- Test coverage and behavior specifications

## Navigation Patterns

### "I need to fix a bug in X"

1. Check **INDEX-ERRORS.md** if it's an error-related bug
2. Look up the feature in **INDEX-FUNCTIONS.md** to find implementation
3. Check **INDEX-TESTS.md** for related test cases
4. Read files identified in **INDEX-FILES.md** by importance

### "I need to add a new feature"

1. Review **PRODUCT-SPEC.md** to understand product context
2. Check **INDEX-ARCHITECTURE.md** for where feature fits
3. Look at **INDEX-FUNCTIONS.md** for similar patterns
4. Review **INDEX-TESTS.md** for testing patterns
5. Use **INDEX-FILES.md** to identify files to modify

### "I need to understand how this works"

1. Start with **INDEX-ARCHITECTURE.md** for overview
2. Trace through **INDEX-FUNCTIONS.md** for call flow
3. Read relevant source files ordered by **INDEX-FILES.md** importance

### "I need to write tests"

1. Check **INDEX-TESTS.md** for existing patterns
2. Review **PRODUCT-SPEC.md** for expected behaviors
3. Look at **INDEX-ERRORS.md** for error cases to cover

---

## File Importance Quick Reference

### Must Read First (CRITICAL)

- `R/init.R`, `R/add.R`, `R/get.R`, `R/status.R`
- `src/rust/src/lib.rs`
- `src/rust/src/library/init.rs`, `add.rs`, `get.rs`, `status.rs`
- `src/rust/src/helpers/error.rs`

### Read for Context (HIGH)

- `DESCRIPTION`
- `src/rust/src/helpers/*.rs` (most files)
- `R/extendr-wrappers.R`
- Test files in `tests/testthat/`

### Read When Relevant (MEDIUM/LOW)

- Build configuration files
- Generated documentation
- CI/CD workflows

## Updating These Indices

When making significant changes to DVS:

1. Update relevant index files to reflect changes
2. Maintain the same format and structure
3. Update cross-references if file responsibilities change
4. Add new test IDs to INDEX-TESTS.md
5. Update PRODUCT-SPEC.md if user-facing behavior changes

---

## Key DVS Concepts for Agents

1. **Content-Addressable Storage**: Files stored by blake3 hash
2. **Metadata Files**: `.dvs` JSON files track version info
3. **Storage Directory**: External directory (outside git) holding file contents
4. **Git Integration**: Automatic .gitignore management
5. **Statuses**: `current` | `absent` | `unsynced` | `error`
6. **Outcomes**: `copied` | `present` | `error`
