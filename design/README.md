# Legacy design docs (historical)

This folder contains **historical** design indexes and specs created earlier in
the project, primarily oriented around the R-first workflow and older CLI
structure.

The **current, authoritative design documentation** lives in
`dvsexperimental_design/` and reflects the sync-first direction and the latest
CLI and storage decisions.

If you are making product or implementation decisions, use the docs in
`dvsexperimental_design/` as the source of truth.
