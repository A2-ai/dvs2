# `dvs`

Rewrite of `dvs`, the data-version-control system made by A2-AI.

DVS (Data Version System) is a tool for versioning large or sensitive files under Git without tracking the file content directly.


## TODOs

- Azure backend
- GC?
- dvs remove?
- integrity check? would need to read the file again after saving it
